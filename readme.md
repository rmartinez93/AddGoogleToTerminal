    $ google "my query"

		$ google --news "world news"

**Instructions**

To install, download the `addGoogleToTerminal.sh` file. Open your terminal and install it as follows:

    $ cd ~/path-to-file/
    $ ./addGoogleToTerminal.sh
		
This adds a few lines to your `~/.bash-profile` file that give you the ability to use the `google` command. Afterwards, restart your terminal to use the functionality, and feel free to delete the .sh file.

**Available Flags**

- `--images`, searches Google Images for a query
- `--news`, searches Google News for a query
- No flags uses regular Google Search

Happy Googling!
